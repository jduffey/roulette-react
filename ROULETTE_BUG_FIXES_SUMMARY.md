# Roulette Game Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the bugs found and fixed in the Roulette game's interaction between the UI, service layer, and blockchain.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. Event Listener Memory Leaks
**Problem:** Multiple components (`MostRecentSpinResults`, `SpinResult`) were registering event listeners on every render without cleanup, causing memory leaks and duplicate event handling.

**Solution:** 
- Moved event listener registration to `useEffect` hooks
- Added cleanup functions to remove listeners on unmount
- Used functional state updates to avoid stale closures

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/roulette/MostRecentSpinResults.js`
- `src/components/roulette/SpinResult.js`

### 2. Infinite Re-render Loop in NumbersHitTracker
**Problem:** Component had `currentSet` in its dependency array while also updating it, causing infinite re-renders.

**Solution:**
- Removed `currentSet` from dependency array
- Added event-based updates with debouncing
- Used `useRef` for timer management

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/roulette/NumbersHitTracker.js`

### 3. Race Condition Between Frontend and Blockchain
**Problem:** Frontend was generating random numbers locally before blockchain confirmation, creating inconsistent state where UI showed different results than what was recorded on blockchain.

**Solution:**
- Removed local random number generation
- Wait for blockchain event (`ExecutedWager`) to get actual result
- Calculate results based on blockchain data, not predicted values

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/roulette/Roulette.js`

### 4. Missing Transaction Error Handling
**Problem:** No error handling for failed blockchain transactions, leaving users confused when transactions failed.

**Solution:**
- Added try-catch blocks around blockchain calls
- Added user-friendly error messages
- Properly reset spinning state on errors
- Clean up event listeners on error

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/roulette/Roulette.js`

### 5. Precision Issues with ETH Balance Comparisons
**Problem:** Using `parseFloat` for ETH values caused precision errors when comparing balances.

**Solution:**
- Switched to using `ethers.BigNumber` for all balance calculations
- Used proper Wei conversions with `parseEther`
- Ensured all comparisons use BigNumber methods

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/roulette/Roulette.js`

### 6. Transaction Confirmation Not Awaited
**Problem:** The code wasn't waiting for transaction confirmation, potentially showing success before the transaction was mined.

**Solution:**
- Added `await tx.wait()` to wait for transaction confirmation
- Only update UI after confirmation is received

**File Modified:**
- `src/components/roulette/Roulette.js`

## Tests Created

### 1. Integration Tests (`Roulette.integration.test.js`)
Comprehensive tests covering:
- Complete betting workflow
- Balance validation
- Blockchain interaction
- Error handling
- Event listener cleanup
- Precision handling with BigNumbers

### 2. Event Listener Tests (`EventListenerComponents.test.js`)
Tests for components using blockchain events:
- Event registration and cleanup
- Proper state updates from events
- Debouncing behavior
- Error handling

### 3. Bet Results Tests (`BetResultsCalculation.test.js`)
Tests for betting logic:
- Winning calculations for all bet types
- Multiple bets handling
- Display of results
- Special cases (0 and 00)

## Key Improvements

1. **Reliability:** Eliminated race conditions and memory leaks
2. **Consistency:** UI now always reflects actual blockchain state
3. **User Experience:** Added proper error handling and feedback
4. **Precision:** Fixed decimal precision issues with ETH values
5. **Maintainability:** Added comprehensive test coverage

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes:
1. Place bets and spin - results should match blockchain events
2. Check browser console - no memory leak warnings
3. Try invalid operations - proper error messages should appear
4. Check balances - should be precise even with many decimals
5. Run tests - all should pass
